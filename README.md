# Revenue Metrics Dashboard (SQL + Tableau)

My role was to represent the financial flow analysis by creating a dashboard that allows us to track and analyze the financial data, including revenue, expenses and profit, aiming to help project managers develop strategies at increasing revenue and optimizing business processes.
- Utilized the SQL (DBeaver) to query the data base, making several grouped and ordered subqueries, aggregation functions, joins between CTEs, to calculate some revenue metrics.
- Exported the result as a csv file and imported it into Tableau to create visualizations that include calculated fields such as MRR, ARPPU, Churn Rate and Customer Lifetime Value.
- Final dashboard contains 6 charts, including MRR Expansion VS Contraction or Month over month Churn Rate. I added some filters to create a little interactivity.
